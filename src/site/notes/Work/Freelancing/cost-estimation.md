# Cost estimate

| App        | Cost    |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Log reader | $3,500  |
| QC         | $3,500  |
| Web app    | $10,500 |
| **Total**  | $17,500 |

Web app is the costliest of all as it has a lot of moving things and needs monitoring & maintenance.

Even to get started with a webapp it needs some initial spending like purchasing domain name, booting servers, database etc.,

Hence, 3 months after the completion of all apps, when the apps are stable I'd be requiring recurring payments for the maintenance of the apps, servers & building new features.

That'll be **$15/month/device**(t-shirt print machines).

## Payment
I'd need $1,000 upfront to cover initial costs. You can pay me in three instalments,
